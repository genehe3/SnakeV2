# SnakeV2
Second attempt at a snake game.
First try was a blind attempt and I had only gotten to ONE moving rectangle, every other rectangle was either broken or didn't want to move how I wanted.
In the end I still learned a lot about using the canvas element so I consider my time well spent. 
This attempt I followed along with a guide, trying to develop my own code for the concepts used by the guide. 
Surprisingly, I only needed a little bit of assistance with getting started with the project and add the finishing touches, such as a hit collsion system for the snake and its body.
90% of the code for this project is original and I have learned even more through the second attempt of this snake game.
